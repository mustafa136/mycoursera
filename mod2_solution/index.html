    Woo-hoo! You get to do some coding! Exciting!
    P.S. If you are falling behind meeting assignment deadlines, don't give up! It's really NOT a problem! Refer to the Grading reading at the beginning of Module 1 to review your options.
    Ask questions in Discussions if you get stuck! We are all learning, and going through getting stuck and then unstuck (even with someone's help) can be a very valuable learning experience!
